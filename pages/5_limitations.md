A potentially important discovery from our data is a seeming disconnect between the picture of Indian missions that would have been captured in federal reports and compiled within the Office of Indian Affairs and that perceived by the leaders of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

The ABCFM was the largest American missionary society and the most significant organizer and funder of Indian missions. It consistently received the lion’s share of federal funding–when combined with major predecessor organizations that merged into the American Board, over half.

Yet the vision of Indian missions from American Board headquarters in Boston was quite different from that of Thomas McKenney in Georgetown. For the Office of Indian Affairs, the well-organized, consistently submitted reports from the ABCFM’s Choctaw schools would have seemed like the crown jewel of the missionary enterprise. In 1826, federal records list eleven of them, all “prosperous,” spelled out with full data furnished by their superintendent, Cyrus Kingsbury.

In contrast, the ABCFM’s Cherokee schools, superintended by Ard Hoyt, did not submit a report that year at all. To make up the absence, the OIA simply included the previous year’s property numbers alongside a note complaining that no reports had been received. These schools continued to receive federal funding despite their failure to submit reports. However, the effects on our report data (cf. our personnel data, which are more complete) are quite profound: we only have reports from Brainerd, the centerpiece of the Cherokee missions, for two years, so we lack full financial, personnel, and student data.

Because our data represents what was received by the OIA, it helps to reveal the disconnect between Boston and Washington. In the American Board’s own records, the Cherokee missions in the Southeast received close to $90,000 in the decade, while the Arkansas Cherokee missions received another $55,000 and the Choctaw missions received slightly less than $55,000. From the ABCFM’s own vantage point, the Cherokees remained the center of their mission enterprise to American Indians.
