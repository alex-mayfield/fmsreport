title: Limitations

Over the course of the proejct, it became apparent that our data sources preseented real challenges to a computational approach to understanding the motivations of funding mission schools to Native Americans. Where possible, attempts were made to address these limitations through supplemental data collection. On this point, two items must be noted.

## Missing Federal Reports

In the process of collecting data from both missionary and federal sources, it quickly became evident that federal reporting was inconsistent on a year-to-year basis for many groups. For example, Figure J shows a highpoint in federal reporting in 1825 with a gradual trailing off of reporting in subsequent years. While there is documentary evidence to suggest that there was a general reduction in the number of mission schools, it is no where near the number reflected in the available reports.

[J](reports hit high in 1825, but many missing from various years, continue after 1825 (net decrease in stations, but not as many reflected, perhaps a reflection of non-reliance on federal funding)

Simply put, many groups were inconsistent in the sending of federal reports on a yearly basis. Sometimes, this inconsistency was even noted in reports from subsequent years. THis gap could have several explanations. Reports may have been lost in transit, submitted improperly, or simply not submitted in the first place.

While the latter might seem an odd suggestion considering the Civilization Fund's free provision of resources, it may not be as strange as one might expect. As our data demonstrated, federal funding contributed a meager portion to missionary organizations' budgets. What is more, funding tended to arrive with our without the annual reprt submitted from the year before. The incentives for reporting, then, were relatively low.

## Note on Use of Data

[K & B] raw vs. ratio give different pictures

Because our data represents what was received by the OIA, it helps to reveal the disconnect between Boston and Washington. In the American Board’s own records, the Cherokee missions in the Southeast received close to $90,000 in the decade, while the Arkansas Cherokee missions received another $55,000 and the Choctaw missions received slightly less than $55,000. From the ABCFM’s own vantage point, the Cherokees remained the center of their mission enterprise to American Indians.
