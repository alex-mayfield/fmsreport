Missing Reports

[J] reports hit high in 1825, but many missing from various years, continue after 1825 (net decrease in stations, but not as many reflected, perhaps a reflection of non-reliance on federal funding)

Because our data represents what was received by the OIA, it helps to reveal the disconnect between Boston and Washington. In the American Board’s own records, the Cherokee missions in the Southeast received close to $90,000 in the decade, while the Arkansas Cherokee missions received another $55,000 and the Choctaw missions received slightly less than $55,000. From the ABCFM’s own vantage point, the Cherokees remained the center of their mission enterprise to American Indians.
