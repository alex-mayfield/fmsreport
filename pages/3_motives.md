Perhaps submitting financial reports to the federal government seemed less important to Hoyt because both individual donors and the ABCFM leadership prioritized the Cherokee missions.

Government funding was relatively less important for the success of the existing Cherokee missions: well below 10% of the total funding for the eastern Cherokee missions came from the government.

For the Choctaw missions, the total was closer to a third. But this is also misleading: a large portion of this was derived from the Choctaws themselves, who employed thousands of dollars of their annuities to support the tribal school system. This was a large part of why spending on Choctaw missions comprised 41.22% of federal school spending during the 1820s.

For both reasonsâ€“the importance of Choctaw self-funding and the relative insignificance of federal funding to the total American Board funds, this data should perhaps lead scholars to a greater skepticism about the extent to which Indian missions were primarily a function of federal Indian policy over against Christian evangelistic zeal.

This approach can certainly be taken too far: we know, for example, that the Methodist Episcopal Church organized its missionary society in direct response to the passage of the Civilization Fund, and it seems unlikely that some of the smaller groups like the Presbyterian Synod of South Carolina and Georgia would have create mission schools were it not for federal funding. But the ABCFM data should, at the very least, signal a note of caution about exaggerating the importance of government support.
