  <h1> Understanding the Logics of Funding</h2>
  <p>The continent-wide network that linked the United States government, Christian mission societies, and Native American tribes is recognized by scholars to be vitally important to the course of nineteenth-century American history, shaping major narratives of American Indian history, American religious history, and the history of the American West. In particular, the actions of missionary organizations, funded in part by the federal government through the Civilization Fund (created 1819) played a major role in dynamics of “civilization” and Removal that profoundly reshaped the lives of indigenous Americans. Our exploratory project, funded by a networking grant from the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU), sought to collect data on the significance of federal funding during the 1820s, the first full decade following the passage of the Civilization Fund Act, along with connected data on personnel, expenditures, organization, and location. The findings of our initial foray into this work are displayed graphically and through narrative in this report.</p>
